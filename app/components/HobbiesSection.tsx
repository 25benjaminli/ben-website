                    I especially enjoy informative writing, as it's gratifying to be able to help people who are curious learning more about subjects while solidifying my own understanding. 
                    I author technical articles on Medium.com (link in the profile section) on topics including medical image segmentation, object detection tutorials, idea generation, and AI ethics.

                    I also like exploring nature and pushing the limits of my body and mind! Some highlights include:
                    <br/>
                    - I ran cross country and track and field (sprinting & jumping) in high school
                    <br/>
                    - Completed the Loon Mountain Race - USA Track & Field (USATF) Vertical National Championship - "Most Competitive Hillclimb" by Runner's World Magazine
                    <br/>
                    - In the summer of 2025, hiked to 8k+ ft elevation at Mt. Rainier in Washington, USA
                    <br/>
                    - Ranked #80 in the USA in May 2025 in the competitive no-move gamemode of GeoGuessr (players guess locations based on randomly selected Google Street View images, 65 million registered players worldwide)
